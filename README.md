## Challenges Faced, Overcomes
### Challenge 1
• As mentioned in [1_requirements](https://github.com/yasirfaizahmed/Dynamic_Data_Structure_library/tree/master/1_Requirements), I was facing a problem of passing the structure pointer evertime a funciton which modifies the list/tree is called this actaully got my head scratched since I did'nt wanted to keep passing the pointer everytime from function to function.

### How I overcame 1
• I just posted my question on [STACKOVERFLOW](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62980973/root-pointer-of-linked-list-keeps-varying-when-passed-to-a-function-in-header-fi) and it turns out I got the answer on how to do it the right way, And rest of the code development went very smooth.

### Challenge 2
• Need a much simpler way to initilize the list/ tree 
Present way,

          sll_node* root = NULL;  //initilizing the list
          sll_append(&root, val); //starting to append the first element to it

### How I overcame 2
• I still need to figure out, need help here
