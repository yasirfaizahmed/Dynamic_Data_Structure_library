## Challenges Faced, Overcomes
### Challenge 
• As mentioned in [1_requirements](https://github.com/yasirfaizahmed/Dynamic_Data_Structure_library/tree/master/1_Requirements), I was facing a problem of passing the structure pointer evertime a funciton which modifies the list/tree is called this actaully got my head scratched since I did'nt wanted to keep passing the pointer everytime from function to function.


### How I overcame
• I just posted my question on [STACKOVERFLOW](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62980973/root-pointer-of-linked-list-keeps-varying-when-passed-to-a-function-in-header-fi)
