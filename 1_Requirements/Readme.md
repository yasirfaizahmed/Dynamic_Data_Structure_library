# Requirements

## Introduction
We all have used some or the other libraries in our life while coding, but have you ever wondered how cool it will be if someone else is using the library that was developed by you totally from scratch? of-course with googling a lot of stuff but stil..

Handeling, managing, ow working with Data structures is hard in C, we have to start from scrach even to implement a simple Linked-list, will it be not good if a library was build to this for you behind the scenes?

So this library is about that creating, handeling Data structures in C like Singly-linked lists, Binary Search trees, Queues etc..

## Research

Well talking about research here, so most of the stuff I got to know about the concepts in Data-structures are from 4th semester syllabus "Data structures and Algorithms", glad I had a good teacher else I would be struggling like others, so anyways.. I got some more concepts from Data-structure classes on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/NareshIT) channels.
