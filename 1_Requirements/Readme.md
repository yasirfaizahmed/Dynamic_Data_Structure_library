# Requirements

## Introduction
We all have used some or the other libraries in our life while coding, but have you ever wondered how cool it will be if someone else is using the library that was developed by you totally from scratch? of-course with googling a lot of stuff but stil..

Handeling, managing, ow working with Data structures is hard in C, we have to start from scrach even to implement a simple Linked-list, will it be not good if a library was build to this for you behind the scenes?

So this library is about that creating, handeling Data structures in C like Singly-linked lists, Binary Search trees, Queues etc..

## Research

Well talking about research here, so most of the stuff I got to know about the concepts in Data-structures are from 4th semester syllabus "Data structures and Algorithms", glad I had a good teacher else I would be struggling like others, so anyways.. I got some more concepts from Data-structure classes on [YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/c/NareshIT) channel. 

And it turns out even I did alot of research, well here's my [QUESTION](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62980973/root-pointer-of-linked-list-keeps-varying-when-passed-to-a-function-in-header-fi) on Stackoverflow when I was actually struggling to make functions on Data structures, and the answer given was so well put I got inspired!! , like really... Other than that I did'nt really went through books for concepts.

## Cost and Features

### Cost 

N/A

### Features
This library till now can handle/ manage 
    • Singly- Linked lists
    • Queues 
    • Binary Search Trees
All of these are written in diffrent source files, so it will be easier to handle debugging later. 

Each of these can do all the below functions totally dynamically!

        • Initilize 
        • append an element
        • delete an element
        • over-write an element
        • swap an element
        • return strucutre length
        • Even sort (both ascending and descending order!!!)


## Defining Our System

The whole system is collection of diffrent data-structures, in out case its composed of Singly-linked list, binary search trees and Queues.

![OUR SYSTEM](https://github.com/yasirfaizahmed/Dynamic_Data_Structure_library/blob/master/1_Requirements/OUR%20SYSTEM.png)

Each of these sub-structure has their own basic functional units called objects(not related to OOP), which has ability to link to another similar object and of-course the allocation is totally dynamic.
